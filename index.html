				<div class="col-sm-5 col-md-4 triptych" id="topOne">
					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Giving back</h4>
						<p>Founders and Coders runs intensive eight week courses to train bright people with no experience to be junior web developers. We accept applications from anyone who is keen to learn, willing to work hard, and collaborate in a team. Charging no finder's fees, we have graduates working in both tech companies and as freelance developers. All graduates are encouraged stick around to help us tackle projects and help pass on the skills that they have learnt here to future students.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-md-4 triptych" id="topTwo">
					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Self-sustaining</h4>
						<p>The course's self-funding model is achieved with two main streams of income: renting out workspace to our graduates (and other developers), and sponsorship from companies who wish to employ them. The Kickstarter we are running will cover the first three months rent to allow graduates to develop themselves professionally. After that, they will be able to fund the space themselves while volunteering time to help teach the next course.</p>
						<!--This allows alumni to enhance their practices and product ideas while surrounded by other developers-->
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 triptych" id="topThree">
					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Replicating</h4>
						<p>The Founders and Coders model relies on very few resources. All it needs is a course leader, passionate people, and a space to work in. And because we nurture an ethos of giving back within a model of education that is self-funding and depends on very few resources, we believe that this course can be replicated anywhere in the world. We aren't just starting a free coding school in London, we are starting a global movement in free and sustainable education.</p>
