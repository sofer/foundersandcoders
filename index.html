					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Giving back</h4>
						<p>Founders and Coders runs intensive 8-week courses to train bright people with no experience in web development. We accept applications from anyone who is keen to learn and willing to work hard while collaborating in teams. We have graduates working in both tech companies and as freelance developers. Most of our graduates stick around to help us tackle projects and help pass on the skills that they have learnt here to future students.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 triptych" id="topTwo">
					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Self-sustaining</h4>
						<p>The course's self-funding model will have two main streams of income: renting workspace to our graduates (and other developers), and sponsorship from companies who wish to employ them. The Indiegogo campaign we are running will cover the first three months rent to allow graduates to develop themselves professionally. After that, they will be able to fund the space themselves while volunteering time to help teach the next course.</p>
						<!--This allows alumni to enhance their practices and product ideas while surrounded by other developers-->

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 triptych" id="topThree">
					<h4 class = "h4-givebBackToTheCommunity">Replicating</h4>
						<p>We do more with less. All the course needs is a leader, inspiring mentors, passionate students, and a space to work in. We nurture an ethos of giving back, within a model of education that is self-funding and depends on very few resources. We believe that this course can be replicated anywhere in the world. We aren't just starting a free coding school in London, we are starting a global movement in free and sustainable education.</p>
